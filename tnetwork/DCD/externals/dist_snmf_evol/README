SNMF_EVOL - evolutionary non-negative matrix factorization
==========================================================

Implementaion for the SNMF_EVOL algorithm described in:

Yu-Ru Lin, Yun Chi, Shenghuo Zhu, Hari Sundaram and Belle Tseng (2008) "FaceNet: A Framework for Analyzing Communities and Their Evolutions in Dynamics Networks", WWW 2008

The main function is snmf_evol.m that calls snmf_evol_imp.p. The implementation details are hidden for proprietary reasons.

*** Usage ***
Run toy_evol.m to see a demo for evolutionary soft clustering.
