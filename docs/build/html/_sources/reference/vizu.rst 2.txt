Visualization

Some methods are proposed to visualize dynamic networks and snapshot_communities.
A simple demo of usage can be found `here
<https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yquetzal/tnetwork/blob/master/demo_visu.ipynb>`_.


Vizualising graphs is already a difficul problem in itself, and adding the dynamic makes it an ever harder task.

We propose two views of the data:

* Using static graphs at the desired step
* Using a lonigtudinal view of nodes only
