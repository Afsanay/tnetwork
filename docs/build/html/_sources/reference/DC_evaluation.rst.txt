Evaluation of Dynamic Communities
*************************************

This section contains functions useful to evaluate the quality of dynamic communities.

They were introduced in XXX.

They can be split in 3 categories:
 * Evaluation of an average value at each step (`similarity_at_each_step`,`quality_at_each_step`)
 * Evaluation of smoothness (`SM_L`,`SM_N`,`SM_P`)
 * Longitudinal evaluation (`longitudinal_similarity`)


A benchmark is also proposed that can be used to reproduce the results presented in the paper XXX.

.. currentmodule:: tnetwork.DCD.analytics.dynamic_partition

Main evaluation functions
