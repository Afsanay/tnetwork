Visualization
*************************************

Some methods are proposed to visualize dynamic networks and communities.

Vizualising graphs is already a difficul problem in itself, and adding the dynamic makes it an ever harder task.

We propose two views of the data:

* Using static graphs at the desired step
* Using a lonigtudinal view of nodes only
